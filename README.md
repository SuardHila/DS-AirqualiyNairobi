Project Description:
This project analyzes PM2.5 (air pollution) data from Dar es Salaam using time series forecasting techniques. The goal is to predict future PM2.5 levels based on past data using an AutoRegressive (AR) model.
 * Data Exploration: The dataset is explored, and the correlation between different variables is examined.
 * Model Selection: The AutoRegressive model is trained on historical data to predict PM2.5 levels. The optimal lag (past data points) is selected based on model performance (using Mean Absolute Error).
 * Residual Analysis: Residuals (prediction errors) are analyzed to check for any patterns in the model's predictions.
 * Prediction & Forecasting: The trained model is used to forecast future PM2.5 levels, which are compared to actual values from the test set.
 * Visualization: The predictions and actual values are visualized using interactive plots to evaluate the model's performance.
